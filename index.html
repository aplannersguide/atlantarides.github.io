Atlanta Rides is a volunteer group that meets twice a month at 
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/codeforatlanta/">Code for Atlanta</a>.<br><br>

We are working with the Coord.co Shared Mobility API to map vehicle locations from multiple operators on one map.<br><br>

Our goal is to use technology to increase shared mobility to decrease car usage.<br><br>

The following Change.org petition aims to allow eBikes and eScooters on the Atlanta Beltline 
by implementing a new set of rules based on courtesy, sound and vehicle speed.<br><br>

Where space allows, Beltline planners coould provide a separate path 
for bikes and scooters while completing the full rail loop.<br><br>

The second path would be on the opposite side of the grassy median, 
where it would also provide side access for shuttles to meet riders at trains.<br><br>

The new city shared mobility ordinance could require that operators (Bird, Lime, Uber Jump) 
allow walkers to report bad driving and poor parking by scanning the ID of shared mobility vehicles.<br><br>
